# Getting Started with Kirby's Simple commercetools storefront

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To get started:

1) yarn install
2) Add your CT Development key to commercetools.js and uncomment (this should be an env file I'm just being lazy...)
Example:
const CTP_PROJECT_KEY=""
const CTP_CLIENT_SECRET=""
const CTP_CLIENT_ID=""
const CTP_AUTH_URL=""
const CTP_API_URL=""
const CTP_SCOPES=""
3) yarn start
